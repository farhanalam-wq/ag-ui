# Gestalt UI Organisation

UI should be organised so that the visual structure communicates relationships — which commands, controls, and elements belong together — without requiring users to read labels or documentation.

## Core Gestalt Principles for UI Layout

### 1. Proximity
Elements that are close together are perceived as a group.

- Place related controls (e.g. Bold / Italic / Underline) close together with minimal gap between them
- Separate unrelated groups with larger whitespace
- Do not use lines or borders as the primary grouping mechanism — proximity alone should convey the relationship

**Example:** A toolbar with `[Cut] [Copy] [Paste]` grouped tightly, then a wider gap before `[Undo] [Redo]`, communicates two distinct command groups without any visual divider.

#### Prefer whitespace over separator lines
Default to **whitespace, not divider lines**, for grouping. Most separators do work that spacing does better — they add noise and a "boxed-in" feel without adding information. Remove the majority and let proximity carry the grouping.

Caveat: a line takes almost no space, so removing it leaves groups too close. **Removing separators usually means adding spacing** — budget the whitespace (occasionally a subtle background or heading) rather than just deleting the line and leaving the layout cramped.

#### Cause and effect stay close
Proximity also governs time: what a click produces should appear next to the click. When a left-hand menu opens content that starts at the far right, the eye crosses the whole screen for every selection, and the user re-orients each time.

- Anchor content to the left edge of the pane, not the centre. Content begins where the menu ends.
- Put the page title and primary action in the top-left of the pane, level with the selected menu row. The first landing point is then a short hop from the click.
- On wide screens prefer three narrow columns (menu, list, detail) over one narrow menu and one wide field. Each step moves the eye one column, never the full width.
- Highlight the selected row and let the content enter with a small motion from the left, so the movement leads the eye.
- Do this the same way in every view. If one screen answers a click next to it and another answers far away, the user learns nothing they can reuse.

### 2. Similarity
Elements that look alike are perceived as related.

- Use consistent colour, shape, size, and iconography within a functional group
- Differentiate groups through visual contrast (shape, fill, size) — not just position
- Primary actions and secondary actions should look visually distinct from each other

**Example:** Destructive actions (Delete, Remove) use a different colour than constructive actions (Save, Add), signalling different intent groups.

### 3. Common Region
Elements enclosed in a shared region are perceived as a group.

- Use cards, panels, or background fills to enclose logically related content
- Avoid wrapping unrelated elements in the same container
- Nested regions should reflect nested logical hierarchy

**A region needs no border — but a borderless one needs air.** Enclosure can come from a border/fill *or* from whitespace alone. When a card has no border or background, generous internal padding and a clear gap to its neighbours are what make it read as one region; without a border doing that job, cut the air and separate cards collapse into one blur. Borderless is fine — cramped-and-borderless is not.

**Example:** Form sections grouped in bordered cards signal that fields inside each card form a logical unit.

### 4. Connectedness
Elements connected by lines or visual links are perceived as related.

- Use connectors, lines, or flow arrows only when a genuine relationship exists
- In navigation trees or node-based editors, visible connections should match data relationships exactly

### 5. Figure / Ground
Users distinguish foreground interactive elements from background context.

- Interactive controls should have sufficient contrast against their background
- Disabled or contextual information should visually recede (lower contrast, smaller weight)
- Modals and overlays must clearly separate from the underlying content layer

### 6. Continuity
The eye follows smooth paths and lines.

- Align related controls along a consistent axis (left edge, baseline, or centre line)
- Avoid breaking alignment within a logical group
- Grid-aligned layouts reinforce groupings through shared axis continuity

## Review Checklist

When reviewing a UI layout for Gestalt compliance:

- [ ] Can a new user identify which controls belong together without reading labels?
- [ ] Is proximity used as the primary grouping signal (not only borders/lines)?
- [ ] Do visually similar elements share a functional purpose?
- [ ] Are unrelated groups separated by meaningful whitespace?
- [ ] Does the result of a click appear near the click, in the same place on every view?
- [ ] Have unnecessary divider lines been removed in favour of whitespace (with spacing added to compensate)?
- [ ] Does visual hierarchy match interaction hierarchy (primary > secondary > tertiary)?
- [ ] Are destructive or irreversible actions visually distinct from constructive ones?
- [ ] Is the figure/ground contrast sufficient for all interactive elements?

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| All buttons same size and colour regardless of function | Similarity principle violated — implies all actions are equivalent | Differentiate primary, secondary, destructive visually |
| Related controls spread across distant areas of the screen | Proximity violated — user cannot perceive the relationship | Co-locate related controls |
| Menu on the left, content starting far right | The eye crosses the screen on every selection | Anchor content left, title level with the selected row; add a middle column on wide screens |
| Overuse of divider lines to group elements | Relies on decoration rather than spatial logic | Use whitespace and proximity instead |
| Identical whitespace between all elements | No grouping signal — everything reads as a flat list | Apply 8pt/4pt spacing scale: tight within group, loose between groups |
| Mixed icon styles within one toolbar | Similarity broken — implies different functional families | Use a single consistent icon set and weight per toolbar |
